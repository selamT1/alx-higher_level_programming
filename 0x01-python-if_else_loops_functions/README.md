Tasks

0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing
mandatory
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number

1. The last digit
mandatory
This program will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
mandatory
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* You can only use one print function with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off
mandatory
Write a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

* Print all the letters except q and e
* You can only use one print function with string format
* You can only use one loop in your code
* You are not allowed to store characters in a variable
* You are not allowed to import any module

4. Hexadecimal printing
mandatory
Write a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecimal (as in the following example)

5. 00...99
mandatory
Write a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99.

6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need
mandatory
Write a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

7. islower
mandatory
Write a function that checks for lowercase character.

8. To uppercase

9. There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important
mandatory
Write a function that prints the last digit of a number.

10. a + b

11. a ^ b
mandatory
Write a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

12. Fizz Buzz
mandatory
Write a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.

13. Insert in sorted linked list
mandatory
Technical interview preparation:

* You are not allowed to google anything
* Whiteboard first
Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.

* Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
* Return: the address of the new node, or NULL if it failed
